# skidoodoo
JavaFX program to create and solve sudoku puzzles. With generators and solvers from all over GitHub.

The initial code came from [SomeKittens/Sudoku-Project](https://github.com/SomeKittens/Sudoku-Project)
and then from an old source folder on my computer. As I wrote unit tests to verify my code, I started
pulling in other generators and solvers.

some good ideas but doesn't actually work except by luck.)
